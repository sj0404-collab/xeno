 * needs TITLE for the same files, and a second copy of this parsing would be a second place to
 * get the 16-byte index-entry layout wrong.
 *
 * Every failure -- unreadable file, wrong magic, an offset that points past the end -- answers
 * null. A truncated or hand-edited SFO must never take a caller down with it: the scanner uses
 * the answer to decide whether to LIST a game, and the package screen to decide what to CALL
 * one, and both have a sane fallback while an exception has none.
