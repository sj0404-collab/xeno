/**
 * Records native calls that XENO's UI makes but XENO does not implement.
 *
 * The point is visibility. A stubbed method that quietly returns a default is
 * indistinguishable from a working one until a user reports "this setting does
 * nothing" - and then it costs a debugging cycle to find. Anything routed
 * through here shows up in logcat the first time it is hit:
 *
 *     adb logcat -s XENO-Unsupported
 *
 * Use that list to decide what to WIRE UP versus what screen to REMOVE. A
 * control with no PS3 meaning (PS2 memory cards, PNACH patches, GUNCON,
 * RetroAchievements) should be deleted from the UI, not left calling a stub.
