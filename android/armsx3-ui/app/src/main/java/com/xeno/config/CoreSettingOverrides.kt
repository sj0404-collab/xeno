/**
 * Edits made on the All Core Settings screen, kept so they survive an apply.
 *
 * There are two sources of truth for the core config and only one of them was durable.
 * [Settings.applyTo] pushes the curated store over roughly 165 nodes on every settings
 * change and on every boot, so anything typed into the core screen that overlaps one of
 * them was silently reverted moments later. Reported as "I enable Use GPU texture scaling
 * and after a while it turns itself off": nothing turned it off, applyTo wrote the curated
 * value back over it.
 *
 * Rather than map every core node onto a curated field, which would have to be maintained
 * forever and could never cover nodes the curated store does not model, the edits are
 * recorded here by path and replayed AFTER the curated push. Last writer wins, and the last
 * writer is the user's explicit choice.
 *
 * Two tiers now, the same shape [ConfigStore] gives curated settings: a global set, and a
 * per-game set keyed by serial. It used to be global-only, on the reasoning that the screen
 * edits the live config tree rather than a per-title layer. The consequence was that a node
 * set to get one title running was then set for every title: turn on Stub PPU Traps for
 * Uncharted 3 and every game booted afterwards ran with it too, with nothing on screen to
 * say so. [replay] pushes global first and the running title's set on top, so a per-game
 * value wins where the two disagree and every node the title never touched still follows
 * global.
