/**
 * Per-title core settings that a game needs to run, keyed by serial.
 *
 * These are workarounds for emulation bugs, not preferences: a title that will not get past
 * its own boot without one is not something a user should have to find out about on Discord
 * and then hand-edit config.yml for. RPCS3 desktop carries the same idea in its per-game
 * configs.
 *
 * Applied at boot BEFORE [CoreSettingOverrides], so anything the user set on the All Core
 * Settings screen still wins. They are a floor, not a ceiling.
 *
 * Values are JSON-encoded exactly as settingsSet expects: bare for numbers and bools,
 * quoted for enums and strings.

        // out, draws, and does it again. 145 timeouts in one session, all on semaphore
        // 0x50300FE0, while the GPU itself was doing 3.06 ms of work per frame. The acquire
        // consistently outruns the release that should satisfy it -- awaited 0x68 against a
        // last_observed of 0x60 -- from the very first frame onward.
        //
        // Turning the flattener off clears it completely and the game boots and plays.
        //
        // Cause not established. The obvious candidate does not hold: flattening_helper only
        // drops registers marked always_ignore, and that set is four INVALIDATE methods with
        // no semaphore among them -- a semaphore release hits the default branch and flushes
        // the batch, which is the safe path. So this is an empirical per-title workaround
        // rather than a fix, and the real mechanism is still open.
        //
        // The other two are for a SECOND failure, further in: the FIFO desyncs and reads a RET
        // with an empty call stack -- 19 of them in one session, last cmd 0x20000 every time --
        // recover_fifo() resets it each time, and eventually gives up and kills the RSX thread
        // outright ("Dead FIFO commands queue state"). The game then sits at 0 fps with audio
        // still playing perfectly, because everything except the renderer is still alive. The
        // stray semaphore acquires that time out alongside it are downstream of the same thing:
        // a desynced FIFO never runs the release that would satisfy them.
        //
        // These two are what the fatal message itself recommends, and they work. Which of the
        // two is doing the work is not established -- both were changed at once and the game
        // has not been A/B'd since -- so both are kept. Ordered & Atomic is the likelier of the
        // pair given the symptom, and both cost performance, which is why they are scoped to
        // this title rather than turned on globally.
