/**
 * Invisible Activity that exists purely to give the SDK an Activity in ITS OWN process.
 *
 * The SDK launches the browser by calling startActivity on an Activity handed to
 * DiscordSocialSdkInit. Since the SDK now lives in :discord, that Activity has to live there too —
 * XENO's MainActivity is in another process and the reference would be meaningless here.
 *
 * It binds itself, kicks off authorization and finishes immediately. The browser hand-back lands on
 * the SDK's own AuthenticationActivity (also declared in :discord), so nothing further is needed
 * here; the app process learns the outcome from the next state poll like any other change.
