/**
 * Cover art extracted from PS3 discs.
 *
 * XENO fetched covers from a GitHub repo keyed by serial. There is no
 * equivalent repo for the PS3, but there is something better: every disc
 * carries its own artwork at PS3_GAME/ICON0.PNG -- the image the console shows
 * on the XMB, and the one desktop RPCS3 shows in its game grid.
 *
 * The scanner extracts it once, on the pass that reads PARAM.SFO for the title
 * ID, so a cover costs nothing after the first scan: no network, no 404s, and
 * it always matches the disc it came from.
 *
 * Keyed by title ID (BLUS30464, BCES01234, ...), which is what PARAM.SFO gives
 * us and what everything else in the app already uses as the serial.

     * because there is nothing for Coil to decode. Requiring bytes makes that self-repairing:
