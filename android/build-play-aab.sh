#                             declared permission that gets rejected, not the code path
#   MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE   all-files access needs a declared exemption the app does not need
#   RECORD_AUDIO              would put "Microphone" on the listing for a capability not shipped
#   libarmsx3_lsfg.so         frame generation is not distributed through Play
#   updateprovider            the FileProvider that hands the downloaded APK to the installer

# Fails closed: if a check cannot run, that is a failure too.

FAIL: upload key not configured (file missing, or placeholders not filled in).

Create android/armsx3-ui/keystore.properties with:

    storeFile=/absolute/path/to/upload.jks
    storePassword=...
    keyAlias=upload
    keyPassword=...

and generate the key itself with:

    keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore upload.jks -alias upload \
        -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 10000

Keep upload.jks and its passwords safe and backed up: Play ties the listing to this key
and losing it means losing the ability to update the app. Both the keystore and the
properties file are gitignored.

# armsx3.noMinify because AGP 9.2.1 cannot bundle with R8 on: R8 writes mapping.prt, a

# compromise.
# Stage the LEGACY core, and do not trust whatever happens to be in jniLibs.
