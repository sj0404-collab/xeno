XENO
=====

A PS3 emulator for ARM64 Android (fork of ARMSX3, itself RPCS3 with the recent
ARM64 improvements). Ships as the **XENO** Android app with a dark
purple/green energy theme, its own boot sting, launcher icon, and wordmark —
everything else keeps the `com.armsx3` package id and the ARMSX3 identifiers
underneath.

Highlights
----------

* Latest RPCS3 upstream code (recent ARM64 improvements included).
* ARM64 SPU/PPU tuning: GBH/GBB byte-gather paths for i8mm/dotprod cores.
  If a title ever regresses to `STOP 0x0`, set `RPCSX_DISABLE_SPU_BYTE_GATHER=1`
  to fall back to the scalar path at runtime — no rebuild needed.
* Core performance presets (Balanced / Performance / Maximum). They now report
  honestly: any rejected setting is counted and surfaced in the UI instead of
  being silently swallowed.
* Cloud save + game sync over WebDAV (`CloudSync`): per-title save archives plus
  cached game downloads. A game is fetched whole, cached locally, and can be
  re-launched without a network; the client also issues a WebDAV PROPFIND on
  `saves/` so a fresh install recovers its saves before any local folder exists.
  **HTTP streaming**: a new `http_file` backend reads ISO files directly from a
  remote server via HTTP Range requests (libcurl: HTTPS with the Android CA
  store, HTTP Basic auth from credentials embedded in the game URL, redirects,
  connection reuse) with a 1 MB LRU chunk cache and sequential prefetch — no
  download required when the server is on a fast network (e.g. a cheap VPS). A
  **streaming PKG install** button uses the same backend to install `.pkg`
  packages straight from the server into `dev_hdd0/game` in one pass, so the
  package is never stored locally. Hardened against zip-slip, connection leaks
  and settings races; oversized archives are skipped, never truncated. One-tap
  presets fill the address for the free WebDAV tiers (pCloud, Koofr, Mail.ru
  Cloud, Yandex Disk, Nextcloud) — you only add your account login. Google
  Drive / Dropbox / GoFile are API-only and need developer app keys, so they
  are intentionally not offered.
* XENO branding (this branch): new launcher icon set (square + round, all
  densities), in-app mark, notification icon, boot intro sting (1080x1080/30fps
  h264+aac, same specs `BootSplashActivity` expects) and a recoloured library
  fallback background GIF. All resource-only — no source changes.

Building
--------

 arm64-v8a and armv8.2 is supported. You need the Android SDK with NDK r27 or newer,
CMake 3.30 or newer, and a JDK 17. Android Studio ships all of these.

Clone with submodules, then fetch the two third party checkouts that are not
submodules:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/sj0404-collab/xeno.git
    cd xeno
    git clone https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/librashader 3rdparty/librashader
    git clone https://github.com/bylaws/libadrenotools android/armsx3-ui/app/src/main/cpp/libadrenotools

Build the core. This is the long part and produces an unstripped library of
around 1.3 GB. The repository's own wrapper is the supported path — it pins NDK
29 / cmake 3.30.5, turns off desktop-only features and defaults to a size pass
(`SIZE_OPT=1`: function/data sections + `--gc-sections` at link, which drops
dead code from the static LLVM link):

    export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
    android/configure.sh -DARMSX3_ARM_MARCH=armv8.2-a+dotprod+fp16
    cmake --build $PWD/build-android --target android/libarmsx3-core.so -j8

The release pipeline builds the single a13 variant (armv8.2-a + dotprod + fp16,
API 33) end to end and produces the APK:

    OUT_DIR=$PWD/release android/build-variants.sh a13

(Set `VARIANTS="legacy a11 a13 a15"` for the full device floor; it runs for
hours. `SIZE_OPT=0` restores the upstream-flat compile flags.)

Strip it and put it where the app expects it:

    llvm-strip --strip-unneeded build-android/android/libarmsx3-core.so
    cp build-android/android/libarmsx3-core.so \
       android/armsx3-ui/app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/

Then build the app:

    cd android/armsx3-ui
    export JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home"
    ./gradlew :app:assembleGithubRelease "-Pxeno.minSdk=33"

The apk lands in app/build/outputs/apk/github/release/.

Note that the core library has to be rebuilt and copied again whenever anything
under rpcs3/ or android/src/ changes. Gradle does not build it for you.

APK size: native libraries are stored compressed inside the APK by default
(~40% smaller). This only affects the custom-Vulkan-driver path; if an
adrenotools driver pack ever stops loading on a device, rebuild with
`-Parmsx3.extractNativeLibs=true` to restore the extracted layout.

The Discord Social SDK is proprietary and is not redistributed here. Get it from
Discord's developer portal and drop it in app/libs/ and
app/src/main/cpp/discord_sdk/ if you want that feature. The build skips it
otherwise.

Running it needs PS3 firmware, which is not included.
